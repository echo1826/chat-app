# Chat-App

## Description
Basic chat app employing the use of websockets to poll for messages. It uses a react front-end and an express.js backend. This project was made to understand how to serve up a react front-end as a SPA with a backend rather than having the react project deployed on it's own.

## Functionality
All messaging data is stored on the front end with react state. Right now any user connected can message out to all users currently connected on the website. 

## Technologies
- React
- Express.js
- Socket.io
- MongoDB
- jsonwebtoken
