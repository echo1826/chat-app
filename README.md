# chat-app

## Description
Basic chat app employing the use of websockets to poll for messages. It uses a react front-end and an express.js backend. This project was made to understand how to serve up a react front-end as a SPA with a backend rather than having the react project deployed on it's own.

## Technologies
- React
- Express.js
- Socket.io
